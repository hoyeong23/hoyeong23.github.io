# Chirpy Starter

The Jekyll team claims that this is to leave the ball in the user’s court, but this also results in users not being
able to enjoy the out-of-the-box experience when using feature-rich themes.

To fully use all the features of **Chirpy**, you need to copy the other critical files from the theme's gem to your
Jekyll site. The following is a list of targets:

```shell
.
├── _config.yml
├── _plugins
├── _tabs
└── index.html
```

To save you time, and also in case you lose some files while copying, we extract those files/configurations of the
latest version of the **Chirpy** theme and the [CD][CD] workflow to here, so that you can start writing in minutes.
